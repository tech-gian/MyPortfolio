## Giannis Zapantis - Website
  This project is a user-friendly web site, so everyone to be able to check out my resume, my contact information, my work, my studies and all of the things written on my CV. It's not the best work I have done, but in limited time I managed to created this simple and pretty website, so I could present myself on the Web.


## Code implemented - Technologies 🖥️
  To implement this, I used mainly ASP.NET Core and I think I did the best I could (given the fact that it's one of my first .NET Core projects😄). The frontend part is written in HTML, CSS and some JavaScript. The backend part (as much as a site like this one needed) is written in C# and used the MVC model for the final composition of the parts. The whole Web Application is hosted on a Microsoft Azure App Service.
  
I hope you like it and contact me for any advises, comments or anything you would like to talk!
